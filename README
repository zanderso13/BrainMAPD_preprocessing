This set of scripts can be used to submit fmriprep jobs to the HPC cluster at Northwestern University

Northwestern uses slurm based syntax to interact with the HPC

Installation:
git clone 

Running multiple subjects:

Each script expects a single input. To run a single subject:

sbatch 

To run multiple subjects:

asdf

Note that, in the first case, you pass a single argument that is a subject's ID number to the function. 
In the case of batch processing, you pass a txt file that has a list of subject ID's that are then read in.
Batch processing does not require any additional syntax to submit jobs to the cluster. This is done automatically.
